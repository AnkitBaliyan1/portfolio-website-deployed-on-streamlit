    Hey, Welcome to my portfolio website.
    I'm Ankit, an Engineer, Civil Services aspirant and an enthusiast about technology.
    
    "In the pursuit of our professional goals, let us not forget to find joy in the journey, for it is within the process that we discover the true essence of our career and life's work." Let me take you through my journey !!

    üéì My professional journey commenced with a `B.Tech` degree in Electronics from `Delhi University`, providing me with a strong foundation in data management and analysis. However, my path took an intriguing turn as I ventured into the world of `Civil Services`, cultivating a profound resilience and a holistic perspective that shaped my approach to solving-problems. Also, I have been through an intensive Business Analytics Certification from `IIM-Indore`, sharpening my skills in Statistical Modeling, Storytelling, and Machine Learning Techniques. This immersive experience fortified my understanding of the intricate interplay between data and business strategy.

    üíº I'm working with `Amazon` and has been part of multiple teams where I developed not only the data analysis and business understanding, but also got strong hold on `storeytelling` and `stakeholder management`. Working with Advertising team, my role is to generate more revenue for Amazon through advertising. I handled clients and their all advertisements running on Amazon. Yes, the job was not easy, specially, making them understand their campaign about performance.

    üöÄ I am deeply passionate about translating complex data into actionable insights that fuel impactful business decisions. With a focus on GenerativeAI, machine learning, business analytics, and data visualization, I believe that every data point holds the key to unlocking crucial business narratives.

    üß† My endavour into `Generative AI`, `Large Language Models` has been amazing. I not only developed but also deployed chatbot powered by strong language models, on `Streamlit` and `Azure` (using `Django` framework). I have multiple applications including `RAG (Reterival Augmented Generation)` for different use cases and is a display of my skills into GenAI.

    üîç Working with `Data Science Masterminds`, I delved into the intricacies of complex survey data, honing my ability to construct robust data pipelines and extract valuable insights from intricate datasets. Each project became an engaging story, teaching me the art of unraveling hidden patterns and trends within the data fabric. My experience at Amazon has further sharpened my business acumen, allowing me to collaborate closely with business experts and communicate insights in a clear and comprehensible manner.

    üåü I thrive on challenges and am eager to channel my analytical prowess into real-world problem-solving, contributing to the success of your organization. Beyond technical proficiency, I bring a deep sense of empathy and understanding, recognizing that every data point represents a unique human experience.

    ü§ù If you are seeking a dedicated, adaptable, and empathetic data science professional, I invite you to connect with me. Together, let's embark on a journey of exploration and innovation, where data transforms into actionable insights that drive transformative change.
